# ML_System_Optimization_Assignment2
This work covers end-to-end development of a parallel ML solution: problem formulation with performance expectations, system design and revised implementation details, practical deployment on a chosen platform, and testing for correctness and performance, including analysis of deviations from expected speedup or accuracy.
